# Hey, I'm Dennis!

**Data Engineer at NOZ Digital (digital division of the publishing house NOZ Medien / mh:n Medien in Germany), Tech Enthusiast and Dog Daddy.**

Hey, I’m Dennis Hendricks, a Data Engineer who is obsessed with data and technology. Currently, I work at NOZ Digital in Osnabrück, where I create data pipelines and models to shake up the local media scene.

In the past, I was a product manager, e-commerce manager and inbound marketing manager. I picked up some skills in making products, selling stuff online and attracting customers.

I live with my wife and dog in Essen Oldb, Germany. I’m a music junkie and I love to explore new sounds and artists. You can hit me up on [https://www.linkedin.com/in/dennishendricks/](LinkedIn) or [https://masto.measure.chat/@dennis](Mastodon) if you want to hang out with me.
